# CIS2500_fileeditor
A file editor maintained by CIS2500 students at the University of Guelph

This project is designed as a learning experiment, and is meant as an outlet where students can familarize themselves with concepts taught in the course.

## To Do/Current Work
For details on what needs to be done, or how you can help, look at the [issue page][issue]. There is no required skill set for contributing, and anyone may help regardless of their ability.

Please make a comment on what issue you would like to work on, and I will assign it to you. Try to take an issue that you believe you can complete. If you are struggling, you can ask for help.

More issues relating to concepts will be added as they are presented in class.

## Contributing workflow

Here’s how you go about proposing a change/addition to the project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

The branches make maintaining multiple submissions much easier.

## Supported platforms
We will maintain the code for Raspbian, as well as OSX.
